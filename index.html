        <p>This is a prime example of how Monkey D Luffy deviates from other Shonen protagonits. The future Pirate King prides himself on being free, so it's only natural that’s what he would interpret that title as. It's not power that’s he seeks. It's not so much as fame or even glory, it’s just freedom.</p>
